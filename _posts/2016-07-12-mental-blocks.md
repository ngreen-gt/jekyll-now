I wanted to discuss a couple mental blocks that I experience and maybe in the process find some simple ways to deal with these.  And maybe it will be useful to you.

## Locking up

When you have so many different avenues it sometime is difficult to make any decision.  When given a list of new things I don't yet know, sometimes I can be overwhelmed by this.  I know that if I am to know it, that I will have enough time to learn these things, but at first glance it is easy to believe I don't know this and give yourself a mental block.  Working to learn what you do well, and not concerning yourself with the vast amount of things which you don't know is important to overcoming this block.

## Random walk

When I see a new topic I know little of I am curious to learn more.  This can majorly distract me from the most important items at hand.  This kind of distracted thinking is something that I've tried to minimize, but largely have trouble with.  I have in the past tried Pomodoro techniques, and may sometime find that those work for me.  Like the dog from Up I see a squirrel and suddenly my mind is lobe deep in ancient Greek poetry or some other randomness.  More could be said about using goals and mini-goals to achieve more focused progression.

The biggest culprits in online distraction are Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit.  It is unfortunate because they also have a great deal of value in learning how to get better at things if you can manage to stay focused.  

## In closing

I don't yet have best practices to avoid these blocks to rational goal-oriented life, but I will continue on in pursuit of simple ways to handle it.  For different people they can manage to keep these distractions at bay, but those methods might not work for everyone.  My advice is to not search too much for perfection, but become familiar with a system that lets you set small goals and to stick to it.
